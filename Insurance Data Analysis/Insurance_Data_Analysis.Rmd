### Introduction

As somebody who is currently training to be an Actuary, I take a great interest in the insurance industry. One common problem for insurers is how to price insurance contracts and, as of late, the default option has been to tackle this issue with GLMs. That is what I plan to do in this document. I have taken a simple dataset from Kaggle detailing health insurance costs associated with a portfolio of approximately 1,200 participants. 

Our goal is to fit a simple pricing model to the data in question. We will eventually convert this model into a simple interactive application using R-Shiny. This will simulate a typical interactive system that you might see on the web when you shop around for car insurance, for example.
