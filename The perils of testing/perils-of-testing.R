#### Why 'testing' requires 'testing' ####

# The problem ----

# You've been feeling under the weather for more than a couple of days and things don't seem to be improving. 
# So, you pluck up the courage to visit your local doctor. He tells you that it's probably just an innocuous
# virus but he decides to run a series of tests on you regardless, 'just to be safe'. 

# The next day you receive your results: your doctor informs you that you have tested positive
# for a very rare disease that has a life expectancy of approximately 10 years from diagnosis.

# "The test", your doctor says, "is 99% accurate."

# You fall to your knees: "99% accurate? My life is over."

# ... Or is it?
