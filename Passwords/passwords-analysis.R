#### Analysis of 'bad passwords' ####

## Background ##

# The following script aims to analyse a dataset containing a series of so-called 'bad passwords'.

# The data is originally sourced from 'Information is Beautiful':
# https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cz7TDhm0ebVpySqbTvrHrD3WpxeyE4hLZtifWSnoNTQ/edit#gid=21

## Load required packages ##
packages <- c("tidyverse", "broom", "extrafont", "reshape2")
for (pkg in packages) {
  if (!pkg %in% installed.packages()) {
    install.packages(pkg, dependencies = TRUE)
  }
  library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
}

## Read data ##
passwords_url <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-01-14/passwords.csv'
common_words_url <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/master/google-10000-english-no-swears.txt'
passwords_raw <- read_csv(file = passwords_url)
common_words_raw <- read_csv(file = common_words_url, col_names = FALSE)

##Â Pre-process data ##

  if (x %in% common_words) {
    return(1)
  } else {

#          which happen to consist of 'uncommon' words!
