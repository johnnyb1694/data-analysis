# Overview of this repository

This repository is intended to capture the majority of data analysis that I have conducted through the use of R.

There are several subdirectories contained within this repository. They are as follows:

* **_Archive**: this folder contains an archive of analyses conducted in the past which are either unfinished or the results of which were inconclusive
* **1. Technical write-ups**: this folder contains technical write-ups compiled to markdown. These are useful for those looking to inspect the mathematical details behind certain posts on [my blog](https://johnnys-blog.netlify.app/)
* **2. Technical scripts**: unfortunately, I don't always have time to create technical writeups in markdown (see above). For this reason, the certain analyses are written into an R script (the contents of which are directly transferred into the .Rmd document I use to write up my blog posts)
